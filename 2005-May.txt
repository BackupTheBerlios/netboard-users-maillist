Hello.

The first public version of netboard has been just released. Please note 
that the application is still in pre-alpha state so you can't rely on 
it for anything. In fact you shouldn't even consider it fully useful 
yet. Nevertheless, you are welcome to test it and report bugs, missing 
features etc. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. 

Have fun! ;)

Hi all.

The 0.2 version of netboard brings you a totally new standard of 
drawing. What's new? Well, see the ChangeLog for details but just to 
summarize: now it can be considered useful, at least in some 
applications ;) As usual bug reports and feature requests are most 
welcome. 

Have fun ;)
